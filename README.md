# tsup

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/tsup)](https://npm.im/tsup) [![npm downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dm/tsup)](https://npm.im/tsup)

Bundle your TypeScript library with no config, powered by [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild).

## What can it bundle?

Anything that's supported by Node.js natively, namely `.js`, `.json`, `.mjs`. And TypeScript `.ts`, `.tsx`. [CSS support is experimental](https://tsup.egoist.sh/#css-support).

## Install

Install it locally in your project folder:

```bash
npm i tsup -D
# Or Yarn
yarn add tsup --dev
```

You can also install it globally but it's not recommended.

## Usage

### Bundle files

```bash
tsup [...files]
```

Files are written into `./dist`.

You can bundle multiple files in one go:

```bash
tsup src/index.ts src/cli.ts
```

This will output `dist/index.js` and `dist/cli.js`.
